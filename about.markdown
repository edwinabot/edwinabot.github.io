This website is my space for leaving annotations and stuff that helped me or had to elaborate and might prove helpful for somebody else. It might be of interest to folks considering me for a project.

### Who am I?

I am a passionate software engineer with many years of experience in software development, starting in 2009. I have deep knowledge of Python and worked with multiple other languages and their ecosystem, including Node.js and Java.

I am a swift learner, highly adaptable, and a strong communicator. I have successfully delivered mission-critical applications and led teams across industries, including cybersecurity, finance, and media. I worked for AttackIQ, TruSTAR, Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, NBC, Dow Jones Media Group, and others.

My AWS Cloud Computing experience includes the development of monoliths, microservices, event-based architectures, and data pipelines. I have experience with Serverless architectures on Lambdas and Containers, and I've used Infrastructure as Code to implement some of them.
